\description{
Imbibition causes seeds to expand, which results in the seed coat or testa being broken. Seed germination begins with imbibition. Imbibition aids in the transport of water into the developing ovules. Imbibition is required during the first stages of root water absorption. Imbibition percentage of seeds was calculated using the following formula (Govender et al., 2008) <doi:10.1016/j.sajb.2007.10.006>
